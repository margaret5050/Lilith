    <button class="accordion">FEMINISM</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Feminism is a combination of social and political movements with a
        common goal to define, develop and demand political, social and fiscal
        rights for women. NB: Feminism is not one thing. It has gone through
        lots of waves and existed in many forms. Today it is a collection of
        (increasingly factional) groups.

    <button class="accordion">MAINSTREAM FEMINISM</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Mainstream feminists try to carve out legal rights and social
        breakthroughs for women within the existing sexist system.

    </div>

    <button class="accordion">RADICAL FEMINISM</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Radical feminists tend towards a view that the patriarchal capitalist
        system will always oppress women and that power will never be shared and
        must be taken. Some radical feminists see a complete dismantling of the
        system and the constructing of a new one as the only viable solution to
        gender inequality.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">SEPARATIST FEMINISM</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Separatist feminists subscribe to a sort of radical feminism that
        believes women must separate themselves from men entirely and start
        over. They believe that women need to remove themselves from
        heterosexual relationships, at least for periods of time, suggestng
        celibacy for straight women. This isolation denies the system valuable
        female resources and allows women to author their own structures.
